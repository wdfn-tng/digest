*Earth Science in the public service.*  Monitoring the waters of a nation.  Conveying and explaining that monitoring to the American people on the Web, informing them.  

It's been like this since 1995, when the U.S. Geological Survey first put real-time provisional streamflow data on the Web.  One of the first water-data feeds in the world.  The beginning of a water-data web presence. 

Since 1995, that presence has evoled, flourished, and expanded by showing:

* *tables* of water data for scientists and engineers;
* *plots* of water data setting worldwide standards of excellence; and
* *maps* of current conditions--doppler radar for water.

This presence was earnest, but like all web evolution it became fragmented and confusing over time.

So what of the water-data web presence for the 2020s?  We will not rest on our laurels, fall behind.  We will not accept the dreary status-quo.  We strive for excellence!  We will modernize the water-data web presence.
